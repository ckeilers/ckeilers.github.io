			<div class="body">This is our final project for CS 148, an introduction to computer graphics. We wanted to create an image of fantasy and including a focus on a reflexive surface. Inspired by the upcoming winter break and a beautiful picture of an <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EEbtBwPUwAATWE1.jpg">aurora</a>, we decided on a little snowman under a metallic lamp that reflected the room as the reference image shows.</div>

			<img src="images/lamp.png" class="portrait" alt="A copper lamp reflecting the room" />

			<div class="body">Each of us created several objects in the room include the snowman with the hat, the lamp, and the computer monitor. Our first draft was in OpenGL with horrible lighting.</div>

			<div class="body">While we continued to find objects and texture images for the rest of the room, we used Blender to arrange objects, place lighting, and test camera angles. In lieu of a flat background in the first draft, we put holiday movie posters on the background wall - <a href="https://hgtvhome.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/hgtv/editorial/blogs/unsized/Kayla/Rudolph.jpg">Rudolph Poster</a>, <a href="https://www.deleuksteonderzetters.nl/media/catalog/product/cache/30/small_image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/1/1/1101017-xmas26.jpg">Frosty Poster</a>, and the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/circlesoft/document/photos/002/745/029/large_9780008183493.jpg?1544841950">Grinch Poster</a>. The computer monitor is a screenshot of the class’s forum page with a cheeky request from the snowman on how to get an A.</div>

			<div class="body">We ran into some trouble when translating our final vision from Blender to raytracing, specifically with a semi-transparent cone with an aurora texture. The cone could either be transparent, but only let the ray bounce once or reflexive. </div>

			<img src="images/rayreflex.png" class="landscape" alt="A darker image than the Blender image due to the rays not bouncing in transparent and reflexive material.">

			<div class="body">One test we did try was changing the color of the lights to see what was going through which resulted in a cool picture but alas no solution. </div>

			<img src="images/raydisco.png" class="landscape" alt="As a test, different color lights were placed in the lamp which resulted in a very colorful image.">

			<div class="body">Due to time constraints we had to remove the cone for the final image. The final raytrace rendering took 24 hours to compile.</div>

			<div class="body">While browsing NASA&apos;s many galleries and archives of their various rover, telescope, and other space-related missions, I came across <a href="https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/voyager-2 "/>Voyager</a> in NASA’s 3D gallery. On a separate adventure, I had studied Roman and Italian architecture. Following Vitruvius&apos;s guideline, the only Roman architect who wrote a book, I made a simple Roman temple object in Blender. What would happened if we combined both NASA’s space gallery and old ancient buildings?</div>

			<div class="body">My first image threw objects together without much care - but it started the idea of creating an anachronistic landscape in front of a colorful <a href="https://images.nasa.gov/details-PIA23402">galaxy</a>.</div>

			<img src="images/firstop.png" class="landscape" alt="Two Roman temples buried in a lunar landscape with Earth and a galaxy floating in the background." />

			<div class="body">Instead of a flat, sculpted plain for the lunar landscape, I explored NASA’s 3D galaxy some more for something more detailed like <a href="https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/gale-crater">Gale Crater</a> and also added another self made building based on Il Duomo. I finally added both Voyager and one of the famous <a href="https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/spirit">Martian twin rover</a>.</div>

			<img src="images/secondop.png" class="landscape" alt="A few Roman temples and an Italian dome buried in a lunar landscape with rover in foreground and Voyager whizzing by." />

			<div class="body">The landscape needed a bit more texture and the Earth needed a storm to round out the final image.</div>
